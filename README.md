The live project can be seen at [this website](https://apple-gsap.jonathas.dev/), and it's basically an Apple website clone that showcases some of what it's possible to achive with the use of GSAP + threeJS (react-three-fiber). Not only that, this website also is also supervised by Sentry, dispatching alerts and useful information for devs to understand if the project is undergoing performance issues, or the user is failing to perform any actions while navigating.

You can also download the project by yourself and run it locally, following the step-by-step below:

# Install and run project

Install the project `npm install` or `yarn install` and then run the project with `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`. This will run the website on `localhost:3000` or another port, in case this one's already in use.
